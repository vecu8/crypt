This is a very versatile otp app and keymaker and more. It aims to solve some of the associated complications of the one time pad. Future versions will have way more functions. see read.html for detailed description. As far as i can ascertain, this is the most advanced otp app on github- probably mostly due to lack of otp apps- but still, lots of thought is in this app. Home brew aes or other crypto apps are easy to make but highly problematic- a simple error can ruin security. OTP apps are simple to implememt, and when used properly even more secure than aes.
